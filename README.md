### Hi there 👋
I am a software developer, data scientist, and an educator.  


- 🔭 Currently I am working with Nepali businesses to optimize their revenue by leveraging data & tech.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced topics in statistics and machine learning. I am hoping to build a strong Kaggle profile.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open sourced impact based software projects specific to Nepal. Anything project relevant to accessing statistical literacy via procies is interesting to me. 
- 👨‍ I have taught courses on Blockchain, Machine Learning, Business Intellegence, Python, Tableau, Cryptography to Masters level students.
- 🛵 I wrote the first line of code for Tootle, the first ride sharing platform in Nepal. Later I took the role of CTO and CDS. 
- 🏋️‍ I am doing 100 pushups, 100 situps, 100 squats, and 10 (lol) pullups everyday.
